      <description>Outreach activities with 11th and 12th grade students through the Department of Health Career Opportunity Programs at UConn Health. This is a program for 11th and 12th graders comprised of classes (e.g. Math and Science) and enrichment courses that include independent projects in STEM, enrichment trips and guidance in career objectives and goals. We will deliver seminars for the participant students, designed to expose them to the many possibilities on STEM career paths and how they contribute to society, including life sciences and medicine.</description>
