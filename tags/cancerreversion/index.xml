      <title>Structure-Based Control of Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>Network control has been originally developed as part of systems and control theory. While the methods developed in this area have been applied successfully to many engineered and natural systems, several factors have limited its application to large complex biological systems such as cellular signaling networks. These include the limited scalability of the methods for large networks with thousands of components, incomplete information to build dynamical models with hundreds of variables, and the linearity assumption for the underlying dynamics by which bi-stability, that characterizes signaling networks, might be affected.</description>

      <title>Structure-based Control to Reverse Cisplatin Resistance in Triple Negative Breast Cancer</title>

      <description>Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are a unique group of clinically aggressive breast cancers for which surgery and chemotherapy are the only available therapeutic modalities. Dr. Ed Liu and his lab, identified a genomic configuration called the tandem duplicator phenotype (TDP) that defines a major subgroup of TNBC. TDP tumors are initially highly sensitive to cisplatin. Despite their initial responsiveness, they develop resistance to cisplatin therapy. The challenge addressed by the proposed project is to test and validate an analysis pipeline to identify therapeutic interventions to reverse cisplatin resistance in TNBC.</description>

      <title>Cancer Reversion: Computational Systems Biology Approaches</title>

      <description>Cancer reversion is the biological process by which tumorigenic cells lose their malignant phenotype. The objective of this project is to develop and apply novel computational systems biology tools to identify molecular drivers of cancer reversion, their mechanisms of action and their clinical application.</description>
